# pseudocoding

Pseudocoding is a practice where a developer will write non syntax code or comments breaking down a very big problem into easier bite size chunk problems.

I notice alot of developers never starting thier project off with a simple pseudocode brekdown. If you get in the habit even on smallest projects it will save you so much time deeper into projects.

## Example

We are going to use a smaller example like a paper, rock, scissors game to understand how to use it.

You know rules of the game and how it works but not necessary the steps to get there when coding it.

We know a user must choose paper, rock, or scissors right?
So lets capture a variable of users guess.

Next we know second player must make a guess. So we will need to capture thier input into variable as well.

Lastly we know we need to determine winner.
So take users guess and compare with other player.

And thats it! Taking an entire game and breaking it down into three managable steps with a plan is much easier then keyboard blazing and editing steps as you go.
